<i>Mabuhay!</i> My name is Ivy! 👋 

A collection of things I’ve built – all grounded in my design, writing, and tech experience.

I draw inspiration from daily life and conversations.

I’m constantly learning as I go, experimenting, making mistakes, and figuring out how to build things that are actually useful.

* 🌍  I'm based in Melbourne, Australia

P.S. Not an expert, just endlessly curious.
